Since you are working with Vite, remember to place this file in your public/ folder. When you run your build, Vite will copy it directly to the root of your dist/ directory so search engines can find it at yourdomain.com/robots.txt.

Here is a standard, "safe" sample that works for most projects:

Plaintext

# General rules for all search engines
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Block access to specific folders (e.g., your templates or scratchpad)
Disallow: /templates/
Disallow: /scratchpad.html
Disallow: /svg-animations.html

# Tell search engines where your sitemap is (if you have one)
